# Client

The client is designed to be deployed to any static hosting service. It is implemented in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). The client requests the schedule from the server when "Load schedule " is clicked and then displays the data.

## Setup

1. after opening a terminal in the client folder, run `npm i` to install the required dependencies
2. create your own `secret.js` file with your firebase config
3. run `npm run start`
4. your browser should automatically be opened to the locally hosted client website :)
